# encryption-decryption-methods

These are files that I made while taking EECS 475, Fall 2016. <br>
This class taught me about encryption and decryption schemes. <br>

###Files: <br>
affine_cipher.cpp - Help for decrypting an affine cipher. Prints out all possible options. <br>
DES.cpp - Performs DES encryption when the user inputs a message and a key.<br>
matrixMul.cpp - Performs matrix multiplication on the matrix [[0,1][2,3]] <br>
s_cipher.cpp - Helps in decrypting a cipher where each letter is replaced by a different one. <br>
vigenere.cpp - Helps in decrypting a vigenere cipher.
